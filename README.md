# This project was created with Next.js and styled-component

### To start a project with Next JS

It could be only `yarn create next-app` or, if we want the styled-components `yarn create next-app --example with-styled-components 'project name'`.

### Why Next JS ? 

Next is quite powerful. It comes with a lot of features for production and itÂ´s possible to say that <b>Next</b> goes a step beyond <b>create-react-app</b>. 

### Why Styled Component ?

Having CSS in JS makes easier to maintaing the code and discard the unused css.

### Deploying with Vercel

The easiest way to deploy a project:
 1. login vercel.com with github account
 2. import the project I want to deploy just by clicking on 'import'
 3. click on 'deploy' button :)
