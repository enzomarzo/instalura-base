# This project was created with Next.js and styled-component

### To start a project with Next JS
 - It could be only `yarn create next-app` or, if we want the styled-components `yarn create next-app --example with-styled-components 'project name'`.

### Why Next JS ? 
 - He is quite powerful. There's already a lot of configuration built into Next.js. The <b>create-react-app</b> is already well configured. <b>Next</b> would go a step further.
